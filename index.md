## Shagdovala - FAQs

1. What are principles on enabling third-party elements?

    The first priority is to be sure most site function for normal browsing is working as how it is expected. The more element is blocked despite that, the better.

2. It this enough (any other privacy tools recommended)?

    It is definitely not enough, some third-party elements contain both normal site facilities and also tracking scripts. Here are some others helpful:
    - [CanvasBlocker](https://github.com/kkapsner/CanvasBlocker): worry-free privacy
    - [Cookie-AutoDelete](https://github.com/Cookie-AutoDelete/Cookie-AutoDelete): think twice before enabling `active mode`
    - [Decentraleyes](https://decentraleyes.org/): highly recommended
    - [Don't Fuck With Paste](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/don-t-fuck-with-paste/): this may break certain amount of sites
    - [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere): take a trunk of RAM & most probably severe performance issues
    - [Neat URL](http://hugsmile.eu/)
    - [NoProfile](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/noprofile/): this may cause some sites behave strange, especially where there are many mouse-hover-based elements
    - [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock): a perfect combination
    - [URL Tooltip WE](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/url-tooltip-we/)

    Plus, if you re using [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/all/), despite that battery API is removed to avoid being tracked, it is also suggested to navigation to:

    - `about:preferences#privacy`
        - at `History` section, select `Never` at `Accept third-party cookies`; check `Clear history when Firefox closes` option whose settings are suggested as at least `Cache`, `Site Preferences` and `Offline Website Data`.
        - at `Tracking Protection` section, select both `Always`
        - at `Permissions` section, check `Prevent accessibility services from accessing your browser`.
        - at `Security` section, **uncheck** `Block dangerous and deceptive content`: this uses Google Safe Browsing API and tracks your everywhere. Use pro anti-virus programs instead if necessary.
    - `about:preferences#search`
        - at `Default Search Engine` section, **uncheck** `Show search suggestions in address bar results`: the search engine provider will collect everything you input in the address bar if this is checked. If you rely on the suggestions, use engines that don't record things instead, e.g. DuckDuckGo.

3. How can I donate?

    [The owner](https://github.com/Rictusempra) has no any will to accept. Check how [other members](https://github.com/orgs/uMatrix-Rules/people) say.

4. What are these strange awkward words on this page?

    They are quotes of a character, `Gnar`, in an MMORPG called `League of Legends`. You may find all quotes [here](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Gnar/Quotes).

## Gnar gada! - USAGE

1. First, choose a rule level you would prefer, [domain](https://github.com/uMatrix-Rules/uMatrix-Rules-Domain) or [site](https://github.com/uMatrix-Rules/uMatrix-Rules-Site).  It is recommended to choose the latter.
2. open your uMatrix dashboard
3. navigate to `Assets` tab
4. import the rules via ticking the `Import` box and paste the URL.

## Shubbanuffa - BEFORE USING

1. I can only ensure most site functions are workable. Use at your own risk.
2. If you are expecting my investigation on any specific site, pls open a new issue at [corresponding place](https://github.com/uMatrix-Rules):
    - give a specific URL
    - point out your uMatrix version & broswer version
    - attach your own rules and, if differ from default, your preferences
    - If you are submitting issue on any site that requires an account (cookies), a valid account mailed to the [org email address](lolipopplus@protonmail.com) may be necessary. By doing that you are trusting [org owner](https://github.com/Rictusempra) enough.
3. Here are service inavailablity things that won't be fixed:
    -  from contents blocked by any built-in subscriptions
    -  caused by certain preferences outside of rule sets or of uMatrix itself
    -  if a site:
        -  is using SSL cert from any untrusted CA
        -  containing **mostly only** pornographic content
        -  reported as a deceptive site
        -  is a private blog site that is not hosted on public serivce
    -  relevant with any plugin, such as Adobe Flash
    -  other issues you should have learnt from uMatrix [README](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/blob/master/README.md) or [wiki](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/wiki)
